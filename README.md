# makewad-rb

Create a WAD2 texture file from a folder of PNGs. Written in ruby.

## Usage

### Installing dependencies

`bundle install`

### Arguments

`Usage: makewad.rb: <in folder> <in palette> <out wad>`

## Why

Based loosely on a [tool](https://github.com/NewBloodInteractive/MakeWad) with the same name from New Blood Interactive. I re-implemented it in ruby to make it easier to run on *nix systems.

## Example
